# Recording sharing

You can share any recording by copying its URL and sending it to a friend or
posting it on a social network. asciinema.org supports oEmbed/Open Graph/Twitter
Card protocols, displaying a nice thumbnail where possible.

## Sharing a link

You can get the share link for a specific asciicast by clicking on "Share" link
on asciicast page.

Any of the options listed in "Customizing the playback" section below can be
appended to the asciicast URL as the query params, e.g.:

    https://asciinema.org/a/14?t=25&speed=2&theme=solarized-dark

Visiting this link will start the playback at 25s and play at double speed,
using Solarized Dark terminal theme.
