# Manual

Welcome to the asciinema manual!

This manual is split into several sections, one for each component:

- [CLI](../manual/cli/) - terminal recorder
- [player](../manual/player/) - web player for terminal recordings
- [server](../manual/server/) - hosting platform for terminal recordings
- [agg](../manual/agg/) - GIF generator
- [asciicast](../manual/asciicast/v2/) - file format used by all of the above

If you're new to asciinema then make sure to go through the [getting started
guide](../getting-started/) first, which gives a high-level overview of the
functionality, then come back here.
