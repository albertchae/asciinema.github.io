# Manual

Welcome to the asciinema manual!

If you're new to asciinema then make sure to go through the [getting started
guide](../getting-started.md) first, which gives a high-level overview of the
functionality, then come back here.

This manual is split into several sections, one for each component:

- [CLI](cli/index.md) - terminal recorder
- [player](player/index.md) - web player for terminal recordings
- [server](server/index.md) - hosting platform for terminal recordings
- [agg](agg/index.md) - GIF generator
- [asciicast](asciicast/v2.md) - file format used by all of the above
